## How to use this project

When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, a series of five prompts will appear on the screen. The first prompt asks the user to input an integer for password length. The next four prompts ask the user if they would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. After the prompts have been answered, a password that fits the user's criteria is generated inside the box with a dashed line border.
